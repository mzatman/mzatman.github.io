                <p> The Jewish studies major at the University of Maryland used to have (STILL GETTING THIS NUMBER) students. Now, it has seven.
                </p>

                <p> The Jewish studies major always had low enrollment, but during the early 2000s, the program
                    experienced a spike. This was because of UMD’s enrollment in the Academic Common Market, 
                    which allowed out-of-state residents pursuing a specific major not available at their state college
                    to come to UMD for a highly discounted price. </p>

                <p> Students from southern states, like Tennessee and Georgia, were drawn in by the convenient
                    combination, with the major reaching its peak enrollment in (STILL GETTING THIS NUMBER)
                </p>

                <p> In summer 2012, UMD announced it would be withdrawing from the Academic Common Market. Following
                    this decision, the number of out-of-state students (excluding international students, who were
                    unaffected by the withdrawal) dipped for several years. </p>

                <p> The Jewish studies major was disproportionately affected. According to Maxine Grossman, Director of
                    the Joseph and Rebecca Meyerhoff Program and Center for Jewish Studies, the revoked financial
                    incentive and increasing focus on STEM careers contributed to the program’s exceptional decline.
                </p>

                <p>“[R]ecent economic retrenchment and negative rhetoric regarding job prospects for liberal arts majors
                    have led families and students to be increasingly interested in pre-professional fields that are
                    perceived to offer a direct path to jobs,” Grossman said. </p>

                <p>Not only are less people committing to UMD for the Jewish studies program, but within the university,
                    there are less people declaring the major.</p>

                <p>“[In 2012] we saw a shift from the University’s CORE requirements of three humanities classes to the
                    new General Education curriculum, which requires only two... Jewish Studies, unlike Engineering or
                    Marketing, is a major that many students only learn about when they get to college, so those
                    lower-level course seats had been a way of introducing future majors to our program. This, too, led
                    to a dropoff in our major numbers,” Grossman wrote in an email. </p>

                <p>The program has been attempting to get more students by updating the requirements for the major. The
                    program used to require dozens of Hebrew language credits, which has since been dropped, and has
                    been remodeled to fit most students’ general education requirements.
                </p>
                <p> The major has seen a slight increase in enrollment since this change, though the number of students
                    has consistently been below 10 the past few years. </p>

                <p> Elaine Berger, a sophomore majoring in business management and Jewish studies, says she has mixed
                    feelings on the small size. </p>

                <p> “You get a lot of attention from professors. But from a viability standpoint, I wish it would grow.
                    Because if a professor leaves, I don’t know if they’ll be replaced. And from a social standpoint,
                    there could be more of a community,” Berger said.</p>

                <p> Grossman is focused on using post-COVID growth to expand the Jewish studies major,
                    offerings, and department. </p>

                <p> This spring, the department will partner with the Do Good Institute and the School of Public Policy
                    to offer Arts & Humanities in Social Innovation, Change, and Justice: Do Good Now, a course for
                    students interested in working in Jewish studies in the non-profit sector. </p>

                <p> Students like Berger have other ideas for how to attract interest.</p>

                <p> “I hope they hire some fresh blood. Right now the professors are on the older side, and while that
                    appeals to me, that doesn’t necessarily appeal to other students,” Berger said. “And some of the
                    courses we can use to fulfill [the major] aren’t even offered, so some guidance on what’s being
                    offered and what we can do would be nice.”</p>
