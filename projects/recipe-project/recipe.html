    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Blueberries are abundant this time of year, and I believe they deserve to be honored by making a dessert with them—Heaven with each bite. With this super easy puff pastry blueberry galette, you will reminisce all the summer flavors and memories while enjoying a flaky pastry filled with lemon sugar-infused blueberries.  An experience not easily forgotten, at least on our books. Galette is an easy way to showcase blueberries or any fruits without the stress of making a pie. A luscious flaky pastry that envelops perfectly ripe blueberries in a free-form. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups blueberries fresh or frozen (no need to thaw)</li>
      <li>1½ tablespoon cornstarch</li>
      <li>1½ tablespoon lemon juice freshly squeezed</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
      <li>¼ cup sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon for sprinkling</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon milk or heavy cream for brushing</li>
      <li>1 sheet puff pastry thawed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <p>1. Preheat the oven to 180°C / 350°F and line a sheet pan with parchment/baking paper.</p>
    <p>2. Combine the blueberries with sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest, and cornstarch. Mix well then set aside.</p>
    <p>3. On a lightly floured surface, roll the puff pastry out just a little then trim it into a rough circle, approximately 9 inches in diameter. Transfer to the sheet pan lined with baking paper.</p>
    <p>4. Pile the blueberry filling into the center of the pastry then bring the edges in, overlapping as you fold the pastry up around the filling all the way around.</p>
    <p>5. Brush with milk or cream and sprinkle with a little extra sugar.</p>
    <p> 6. Bake the galette in the preheated oven for 30-45 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown and crisp and the blueberries are soft, and the filling has thickened slightly.</p>
    <p>7. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes before slicing and serving with ice cream.</p>
